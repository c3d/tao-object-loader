License: LGPL
SVN repository is at:
https://glc-lib.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/glc-lib/glc-lib

Current version is: 2.2.0
                  + some Taodyne changes to support colored objects (#1182)
                  + upstream commits included in 2.2.1, to fix #1507

Note: glc-lib contains 2 project files (.pro):
 * GLC_lib.pro: the real one (from the GLC lib source repository)
 * glc-lib.pro: the project file used by the Tao module. Includes GLC_lib.pro
   and redefines some variables so that "make install" does the right thing.
